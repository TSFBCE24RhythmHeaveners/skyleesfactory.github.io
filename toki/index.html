		<h2>Welcome to my <q>blog</q></h2>
		<p>On several occasions has there been a thought I would like to write down somewhere, and/or tell people about. Therefore I created this <q>blog</q>, where I can notate those thoughts for the world to see.</p>

		<h2>9/2-2025: Checking out my youtube comments</h2>
		<p>Apparently I don't have notifications on for any sort of comment interactions on youtube. This is why I today decided to check on my recent comments to see how they were doing. First of all, I noticed most of them had zero likes, which makes sense statistically. Second of all, I realized one comment on <a href="https://youtu.be/xo5UkGhdTLM">a vsauce short</a> had a heart from Michael Stevens himself, which I thought was pretty cool, especially considering I couldn't even find another hearted comment on that video.</p>
		<img src="../media/images/vsauce.png" alt="screenshot of my hearted comment which reads: 'Great video, terrible proto indo european pronunciation, 10/10'">
		<p>I also found this old comment on <a href="https://youtu.be/8ixgZOW2V7w">a video with way fewer views</a>, where I calculated when it would reach the like goal of 10 million. Because I don't have notifications on, I never noticed that the creator of the video asked me to bring guac for the party in 2221. Glad I caught this now before the party, or it would have been very awkward.</p>
		<img src="../media/images/guac.png" alt="screenshot of a less interesting comment I left">
		<p>On <a href="https://youtu.be/if5AbMYR9gI">this minecraft video</a>, I proposed an alternate title which I myself found very funny. Apparently other people did as well, because I have been liked all the way to the top comment. That's pretty cool, even though there are only 200 something comments.</p>
		<img src="../media/images/frail.png" alt="screenshot of my hearted comment which reads: 'Alternate title: Minecraft but I'm extremely hungry and frail'">
		<p>On most of the comments that have replies, at least one is notifying me about the fact that my profile picture indeed resembles the toki pona logograph for soweli, which I think is really fun, because that means that toki pona people exist outside toki pona communities!</p>
		<p>This concludes my first blog post on this website, and I now know that writing satisfying conclusions on short texts is hard. Bye!</p>
