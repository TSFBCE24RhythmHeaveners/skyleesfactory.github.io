		<h2>Things I've made</h2>
		<p>When people ask about me, I tell them I'm a creative person. I also believe that, even though I don't have too much stuff to show. This page will collect various things I've made and/or am proud of, even though there's not much here yet.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="box">
		<h2>Interactives</h2>
		<p>These are Javascript based interactive things I've made. I don't really know JS so these are pretty cobbled together, and only some work on mobile.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p><a href="../ambigenerator/">Ambigram Generator</a> - The thing that I think made my website pretty popular on google search.</p></li>
			<li><p><a href="../morse keyer/">Morse Keyer</a> - A keyer for morse code that only works on desktop, but it's pretty good!</p></li>
			<li><p>Literally nothing else. Sorry!</p></li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Fonts</h2>
		<p>Here are a few small fonts I've made in a web app called fontstruct. It's not a good way to make fonts in my opinion, but it is fun to play around with. If you want you can look at and download the fonts from <a href="https://fontstruct.com/fontstructors/2414088/molerat">my fontstruct page</a>!</p>

		</div>
		<p>This is a modified version of Jetbrains Mono that I've used as my one and only coding font for a few months at this point. I made it intentionally quirky and weird, but I really like it! </p>
		<div class="gallery"><img src="../media/images/fontsamples/jetbrains silly.webp"></div>
		<p>It's also proportional (not monospaced), even though I use it for coding. This is because propotional typefaces are secretly better than monospaced fonts at everything (except ascii art, terminals, markdown, assembly, etc). My point still stands, regular programming should not require a monospaced font, and the uneven color of monospaced type is pretty ugly, so proportional it is.</p>

	<div class="box">
		<h2>Songs</h2>
		<p>I have but dabbled in music composition and production, as in I've sometimes tried putting down notes over chords until I like it. I've made some pretty uninteresting background tracks for small games I've made, but a while ago I made this chiptune (specifically 2A03) song that's over 3 minutes. It is however quite repetitive, which explains the length. Either way I'm very proud of it because I think it's a banger.</p>

		<p>I would love to make more bops, and I will of course put them here in that case.</p>

		<h2>This site</h2>
		<p>Here is a timeline of what's happening on this website:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>10/5-2023: Finished the first version of the ambigram generator. It is made in ios shortcuts and looks horrendous.</p></li>
			<li><p>11/5-2023: The ambigenerator is reprogrammed in python using Pillow. It's very slow and hosted on replit.</p></li>
			<li><p>24/10-2023: The third version of the generator includes several options per word, and it uses the glyphs marked as <q>alternate</q> in the current one!</p></li>
			<li><p>27/10-2023: Made a website unrelated to the ambigenerator, but it only had one page and a sentence of text.</p></li>
			<li><p>end of 2023: I learned html and css. Literally after I made the website because then I just guessed.</p></li>
			<li><p>23/1-2024: It's now remade in Javascript and hosted on the second page of the old website!</p></li>
			<li><p>8/2-2024: I finished drawing the new vector glyphs that are still in the generator today!</p></li>
			<li><p>19/3-2024: The morse keyer was added to my website, making it three pages big!</p></li>
			<li><p>9/1-2025: After exploring some webrings I realized I should make a better website, and I started working on this one.</p></li>
			<li><p>13/1-2025: Added the morse code keyer and ambigram generator, as well as writing an entire essay as the home page.</p></li>
			<li><p>16/1-2025: Finished the new website and published it on the same github domain as the old one!</p></li>
			<li><p>11/2-2025: I added a <q>things I've made</q> and a <q>stuff I like</q> page, as well as changing some fonts and adding something one might call a blog.</p></li>
