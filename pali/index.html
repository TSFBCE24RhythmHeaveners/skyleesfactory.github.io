		<h2>Things I've made</h2>
		<p>There's not much here yet, but I make stuff all the time and if I like it I might put in on this page!</p>
	</div>

	<div class="box">
		<h2>Interactives</h2>
		<p>These are Javascript based interactive things I've made. I don't really know JS so these are pretty cobbled together, and only the ambigenerator works on mobile.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p><a href="../ambigenerator/">Ambigram Generator</a> - The thing that I think made my website pretty popular on google search.</p></li>
			<li><p><a href="../morse keyer/">Morse Keyer</a> - A keyer for morse code that only works on desktop, but it's pretty good!</p></li>
			<li><p>Literally nothing else. Sorry!</p></li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Fonts</h2>
		<p>Here are a few small fonts I've made in a web app called fontstruct. It's not a good way to make fonts in my opinion, but it is fun to play around with. If you want you can look at and download (some of) the fonts from <a href="https://fontstruct.com/fontstructors/2414088/molerat">my fontstruct page</a>!</p>
		<div class="gallery">

			<img src="../media/images/fontsamples/five high sample.webp" alt="">
			<img src="../media/images/fontsamples/jetbrainsish.webp" alt="">
			<img src="../media/images/fontsamples/mono one sample.webp" alt="">
		</div>
		<p>These two are fonts I've used for coding, and both are proportional alterations of Jetbrains Mono. The left one is based on maximal letter differentiation, in that every letter is as unique as possible, which is why it's so quirky and wacky.</p>
		<div class="gallery">
			<img src="../media/images/fontsamples/jetbrains silly.webp" alt="">
		</div>
		<p>Lastly, this one is what I currently use to code, with Jetbrains Mono on the right. They're identical, except for the i, l, w, W and m, which have all been adjusted to not be monospaced. It makes it read nicer to me, and the overall density of text isn't thrown off by the otherwise very tight lowercase m.</p>

		<h2>Songs</h2>
		<p>I have but dabbled in music composition and production, as in I've sometimes tried putting down notes over chords until I like it. I've made some pretty uninteresting background tracks for small games I've made, but a while ago I made this chiptune (specifically 2A03) song that's over 3 minutes. It is however quite repetitive, which explains the length. Either way I'm very proud of it because I think it's a banger.</p>

		<p>I would love to make more bops, and I will of course put them here in that case.</p>

		<h2>This site</h2>
		<p>Here is a timeline of what's happening on this website:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>10/5-2023: Finished the first version of the ambigram generator. It is made in ios shortcuts and looks horrendous.</p></li>
			<li><p>11/5-2023: The ambigenerator is reprogrammed in python using Pillow. It's very slow and hosted on replit.</p></li>
			<li><p>24/10-2023: The third version of the generator includes several options per word, and it uses the glyphs marked as <q>alternate</q> in the current one!</p></li>
			<li><p>27/10-2023: Made a website unrelated to the ambigenerator, but it only had one page and a sentence of text.</p></li>
			<li><p>end of 2023: I learned html and css. Literally after I made the website because then I just guessed.</p></li>
			<li><p>23/1-2024: It's now remade in Javascript and hosted on the second page of the old website!</p></li>
			<li><p>8/2-2024: I finished drawing the new vector glyphs that are still in the generator today!</p></li>
			<li><p>19/3-2024: The morse keyer was added to my website, making it three pages big!</p></li>
			<li><p>9/1-2025: After exploring some webrings I realized I should make a better website, and I started working on this one.</p></li>
			<li><p>13/1-2025: Added the morse code keyer and ambigram generator, as well as writing an entire essay as the home page.</p></li>
			<li><p>16/1-2025: Finished the new website and published it on the same github domain as the old one!</p></li>
			<li><p>11/2-2025: I added a <q>things I've made</q> and a <q>stuff I like</q> page, as well as changing some fonts and adding something one might call a blog.</p></li>
		</ul>
