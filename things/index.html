        <h2>Timeline</h2>
        <p>Here is a timeline of what's happening on this website:</p>
        <ul class="spaced_list">
            <li>10/5-2023: Finished the first version of the ambigram generator. It is made in ios shortcuts and looks horrendous.</li>
            <li>11/5-2023: The ambigenerator is reprogrammed in python using Pillow. It's very slow and hosted on replit.</li>
            <li>24/10-2023: The third version of the generator includes several options per word, and it uses the glyphs marked as "alternate" in the current one!</li>
            <li>27/10-2023: Made a website unrelated to the ambigenerator, but it only had one page and a sentence of text.</li>
            <li>end of 2023: I learned html and css. Literally after I made the website because then I just guessed.</li>
            <li>23/1-2024: It's now remade in Javascript and hosted on the second page of the old website!</li>
            <li>8/2-2024: I finished drawing the new vector glyphs that are still in the generator today!</li>
            <li>19/3-2024: The morse keyer was added to my website, making it three pages big!</li>
            <li>16/10-2024: I reprogrammed the morse code keyer with a timing slider, because it was actual spaghetti before.</li>
            <li>9/1-2024: After exploring some webrings I realized I should make a better website, and I started working on this one.</li>
            <li>13/1-2024: Added the morse code keyer and ambigram generator, as well as writing an entire essay as the home page.</li>
            <li>16/1-2024: Finished the new website and published it on the same github domain as the old one!</li>
        </ul>
