		<h2>Things I enjoy</h2>
		<p>This page is for documenting things I like and recommend, such as youtube videos, browser extensions, and nothing else yet. I've been told there's more to life than videos and browser add-ons though, so this list might grow.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="box">
        <h2>My favorite videos</h2>
        <p>I love watching youtube. Go to my <a href="../video recs/">Video Recommendation Logâ„¢</a> to see a number of youtube videos I like and recommend you watch.</p>
    </div>

	<div class="box">
		<h2>My favorite fonts</h2>
		<p>It's difficult to decide which fonts I <q>like the most</q>, because different fonts are pretty in different ways. San Francisco Pro (the apple font) and Jetbrains Mono are both very aesthetically pleasing to me. Inter and IBM plex sans are also pretty in similar ways.</p>
		<p>Afterglow and Domaine Display are both very nice looking serif typefaces, as well as Bookman.</p>
		<p>Input Sans is my favorite font for coding (except for <a href="../pali/#fonts">my custom font</a>), mostly because it's proportional. It's designed to keep all the benefits of typical monospaced fonts, like the clear punctuation and high letter differentiation (e.g. I/l), while avoiding the flaws like bad kerning (e.g. the spacing in <q>LT</q>), and a squished lowercase m.</p>

	<div class="box">
		<h2>My favorite browser extensions</h2>
		<p>I don't know of too many browser extensions, but the ones I do know are good, and you should probably install them. Also, you should use Firefox (I've been told).</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Ublock Origin - The best adblocker I think. If you don't have adblock for youtube, is it really worth it to still watch youtube? (no)</p></li>
			<li><p>Dark reader - Not good for some websites, but ouchie owie light mode</p></li>
			<li><p>Grepper - It makes centering divs much easier</p></li>
			<li><p>DeArrow - This makes youtube thumbnails and titles user submitted to prevent clickbait. I like it.</p></li>
			<li><p>Sponsorblock - Time is money and watching sponsored segments give creators money indirectly. But ew</p></li>
			<li><p>FontFinder - You can select fonts and right click to see what they are. Good when you see a really sexy typeface</p></li>
			<li><p>YT-shorts block - They're no fun, are they?</p></li>
		</ul>
